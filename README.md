Nashville Click Quiz
====================

Nashville Click Quiz in Javascript

This is an html/css/javascript implementation of a scratch application I helped build at the Nashville Click event on March 8th 2014.

To run the application, click the 'Download ZIP' button on the right of this page.  Extract the contents of the file and double click the 'index.html' file.
